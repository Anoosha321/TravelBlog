    <h1>Virginia, USA</h1>
    <p>For much of my childhood between the ages of 4-10 I lived in the state of Virginia.
    It was a state that would allow you to experience the joy of every season.
    Unlike in Texas, where most of the year we are stuck in a never-ending summer, Virginia allows an experience where you get to enjoy the changing of leaves in fall, the first snowfall of winter, and the beautiful flowers that sprout in the spring.
    Another one of my favorite things about Virginia was how there was a vast number of activities that you could do here from visiting caverns, to the beautiful green valleys, and even getting to visit the capital of the U.S which was only a couple hours away.</p>
    <h2>Shenandoah Valley</h2>
    <p>One of the most memorable experiences for me was visiting Shenandoah Valley which was located near the eastern panhandle of West Virginia.
    If you enjoy a place filled with rich history as well as spectacular views, then this would defiantly a place to go.
    The geographic valley was known for being a major player during the Civil War, as it provided the place for many raids to occur.
    Now, this valley provides as a recreational site where many tourists go to enjoy the various activities such as hiking, horseback riding, fishing, visiting museums, and more. </p>
    <p>We decided to go on a tour of the Luray Caverns, a cave discovered in 1878 which quickly became famous for its stalactites, stalagmites, flowstone, as well as mirrored pools.
    The entire tour of the cavern lasts about 45 minutes to an hour, and visitors are allowed to bring small pets if they are a leash.
    As we went along, we observed that the cave was filled with these different rock formations which left many of the visitors as well as us in awe.
    The cave also included a war memorial which honored those who were from Page County, a nearby historic little town.</p>
    <p>After finishing up the cavern tour, we decided to go back to the main park area of Shenandoah Valley, and found ourselves a nice picnic spot to have some lunch.
    Once, we all had finished up our lunch we decided to take one last ride around the valley to enjoy the view then head back home.</p>
    <p>Overall, I would definitely recommend visiting the state of Virginia not only because of the amazing weather but also because of the historical significance the state holds.
    If your somebody who is a history geek as well as a nature fanatic, Virginia definitely has the best of both worlds.</p>
