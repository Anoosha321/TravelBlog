    <h1>Get To Know Me</h1>
    <p>Hey there! My name is Anoosha Syed and I’m just your average 20-year-old who wishes
    there was a good way to balance college, work, and travel.
    Although, I haven’t traveled as much as the typical travel blogger,
    I still would like to document my experiences to the places
    I have been mainly for my own memories as well as anyone who
    finds visiting nature and exploring various cultures interesting.</p>
    <p>Travelling to different places and experiencing different cultures and customs
    has always been something that I was very drawn to as a young child.
    I think coming from a family who originated from Pakistan,
    which is a country that in itself has so many amazing places to travel and so much culture to learn from,
    also played a big part in discovering this passion of mine. </p>
