  <h1>Texas, USA</h1>
  <h2>Austin</h2>
  <p>Austin has been my home now for about 9 years now and it safe to say it holds a lot of diversity in the people, the culture, and in the landscapes.
  Being the capital of Texas, the top reason people come to this city is to visit the capital building and explore the downtown in which it is located in.
  The capital building holds many tours which you can take to learn about the history of Texas and how the state government works, or you can just go in for free and look around and take pictures.</p>
  <p>Conveniently, the capital building is located right in the heart of downtown.
  Downtown Austin is definitely a very lively city that includes various amounts of restaurants, museums, bars, shopping stores, and more.
  One of my favorite things to do is to kayak under the Congress Bridge also known as the bat bridge.
  If you come during sunset time you see a line full of people waiting for these small creatures to fly out in groups of thousands. </p>
  <p>Another tourist location where we take a lot of our relatives when they come to visit us in Austin is Lake Travis.
  Just driving to get there is an amazing experience which makes you forget your in Texas because of the elevation of the hills and the amazing lake view.
  There is also a famous restaurant called the Oasis where many people go to take pictures, enjoy the view, and eat a delicious meal.</p>
  <p>Overall, Austin is a nice city to visit if you prefer a place that includes entertainment for all ages.</p>
  <h2>Galveston</h2>
  <p>Galveston is a city that we usually go and visit around the summertime mainly for its beaches.
  I remember most summers in the past we have always drove to Galveston Beach when we wanted the full summer experience.
  Although, it’s not like the crystal blue waters of the Bahamas it still provides a fun experience to have with family.
  The beach also has a boardwalk which includes many restaurants as well as many thrill carnival style rides.
  I would recommend bringing your own beach chairs and umbrella if you can, otherwise they do sell some at the beach, but they are a bit costly.
  Overall, a nice city to vist if you are looking for a beach vibe in Texas.</p>
