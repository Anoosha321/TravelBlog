            <li><a href="index.html">Module 1: Getting Started with HTML5</a><br>
						This lesson we focused on the basics of HTML and how to structure a website. To create my website I used Komodo edit and used what I learned from the class to format the various pages of my website. I linked my homepage as an example of where HTML was used to set up the foundation.</li>
            <li><a href="../css/SyedAnoosha_styles.css">Module 2: Getting Started with CSS</a><br>
						This lesson was focused on how to style a website using CSS and the various features that encompass it. I think my index stylesheet is a good example of many of the styling techniques we learned in this module.</li>
            <li><a href="final_AboutMe.html">Module 3: Designing a Page Layout</a><br>
						 In this lesson we focused on various styles and properties that can be used to design a page layout. In my "About Me" page I used the display property "block" to center my image side by side with the text paragraphs. Also all of my pages included a navigation bar at the top along with a header, and a footer at the bottom. This way the website has a uniform look to it.</li>
            <li><a href="fp_colorado.html">Module 4: Graphic Design with CSS</a><br>
						 In this lesson we learned techniques on how to enhance text and create borders and shadows around various page elements. On each of my destination pages I used a border shadow style to enhance the page and add a little 3d type of effect to the page.</li>
            <li><a href="index.html">Module 5: Designing for the Mobile Web</a><br>
              This lesson was about how to make our website more mobile friendly. I made it so that whenever the screen gets smaller the navigation bar would display a navicon which you would hover on to diplay the other pages in the site. Along with that the text and any image in that particular page would also shrink to a size which would fit the screen it is displayed on. I linked my homepage once again to test this out.</li>
            <li><a href="final_NextStop.html">Module 7: Designing a Web Form</a><br>
						  This lesson was focused on creating and designing web forms. I used an input style form on the "Next Stop" Page where the user could type in their responses. It was also a good way for me to gain feedback from my website readers on what their favorite travel expierence was.</li>
            <li><a href="fp_california.html">Module 9: Getting Started with JavaScript </a><br>
              This lesson we touched on the basics of Javascript. I impelimented javascript in my destination pages where I put the images in a slideshow gallery where you can use the back and forth arrow to view the different pictures.</li>
