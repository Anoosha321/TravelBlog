    <h1>Colorado, USA</h1>
    <p>Traveling to Colorado was a very spontaneous trip that my family and I decided to take earlier this year, in the month of August.
    We only spent about five days here and that’s not including the two and half extra days it took to reach Colorado since we chose to go there by road. </p>
    <p>We set off on a 15-hour long road trip from Austin, Texas to our ultimate destination, Breckenridge, Colorado.
    To tell you the truth, it was a long and grueling car ride, we passed by the barren lands of Northwestern Texas for about six hours then through the hillsides of New Mexico and finally to Colorado.</p>
    <h2>Breckenridge</h2>
    <p>The first day after reaching Colorado, we spent our time exploring the infamous ski town of Breckenridge.
    Breckenridge was a beautiful town that held unimaginable beauty.
    Our Airbnb that we had rented for our stay was surrounded by beautiful tall trees and mountains that could be seen glistening with white ice on their peaks.
    Once, we had all gotten ready for the day we decided to head into town and explore what Breckenridge had to offer. </p>
    <p>Since we visited during the summer, we obviously couldn’t go skiing which was one of the main reasons’ folks came out to Breckenridge.
    However, the gondola rides were still open and available to go on and enjoy the spectacular views.
    Along with the gondola rides, you also had a mini rollercoaster ride that you could go on but that was only a one-person ride, so we decided against it. </p>
    <p>After enjoying the amazing view on the gondola, we decided to explore around Main Street.
    It was certainly a lively little town filled with restaurants, galleries, and shopping stores.
    The place was buzzing with many people, mostly families with young children, indicating that this town was definitely a family hotspot for vacations all year round.
    After, having an adventure packed day from going on mini trails, to riding on gondolas, and exploring town a bit we decided to head back to our Airbnb and rest up for what the next couple of days had in store for us.</p>
    <h2>Grand Lake</h2>
    <p>The next day we decided to get up bright and early and head off to the infamous Rocky Mountain National Park which was about 2 ½ hours from where we were staying at.
    Rocky Mountain National Park is a huge national park which encompasses a variety of landscapes such as mountains, forests, and lakes.
    I recommend that if you are here with family you should visit Grand Lake, it’s another beautiful town which is set right beside the huge lake that is surrounded by the Colorado Rockies.
    The town is bustling with tourists who are seen walking in and out of shops, restaurants and historical museums.
    You also have various types of boat rentals such as pontoons, jet skis, or sailboats.
    We chose to rent a pontoon for around an hour and a half and enjoyed the fresh breeze of the Rockies as well as the amazing view.
    After having a relaxing boat ride with an amazing view, we ate some lunch in a nearby park and walked around town some more. </p>
    <h2> Vail</h2>
    <p>After seeing the Rockies, the previous day, our last stop before the trip came to a close the next day was heading to see Aspen.
    It was a two-hour drive from Breckenridge, however on the way we stopped by at a place called Vail.
    Vail is a beautiful town with a sort of European touch to it.
    The town was scattered with various types of beautiful flowers hanging from the buildings or in big vases around town.
    Since we only had an hour to spare here, we decided to visit the botanical garden that many people had mentioned was worth seeing.
    While walking through the town it reminded me a lot of the previous towns we had seen, very lively and welcoming. </p>
    <p>The botanical garden is definitely a must-see sight if you ever get the chance to visit Vail.
    It has all kind of colorful flowers and plants, even had a mini waterfall that you can enjoy while having a seat on a nearby bench.
    I think Vail was definitely one of my favorite towns to visit.</p>
    <h2>Aspen </h2>
    <p>Last but definitely not the least, we arrived at the very well-known ski resort town of Aspen.
    This town is known for its high-end restaurants and designer brand stores as well as the amazing surrounding view of the Colorado Rocky Mountains.
    Although, I would recommend coming here around wintertime because they say the town is most alive during that season and looks the most magical as well.
    Nevertheless, it has its own perks in the summertime as well because you get to enjoy the views without worrying about catching a cold. </p>
    <p>After finishing up our lunch, we decided to head over to the gondola rides first and then explore the rest of the town later on.
    This gondola ride was way longer and higher than the one we took in Breckenridge.
    The view at the top was spectacular because you could see far into the Rocky Mountains.
    We spent some time taking pictures and soaking in the view then decided to head back down and explore more of what the town had to offer.</p>
    <p>We went through and window-shopped at some of the designer stores and finally found a nearby Starbucks and bought ourselves a couple of drinks and headed to the main area of town to listen to some live music.
    After a couple of hours, we decided to head back to our Airbnb before it got too dark to start our packing early for the following day where we would set back on the road home to Texas.</p>
