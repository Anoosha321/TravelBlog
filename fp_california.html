    <h1>California, USA</h1>
    <p>California, the sunshine state, holds a special place in my heart because of all the great memories I’ve had there vacationing with my family every couple of months to go and see our relatives.
    We would spend most of our time in the city of Sacramento, which is where our family resided.
    I don’t remember much about staying in Sacramento, but I do remember the time we took a trip to San Francisco to see the infamous Golden Gate Bridge.</p>
    <p>Though, I was pretty young I would say around 7-8 years old I still remember the first time I saw the Golden Gate Bridge.
    It was amazing to be able to see such a spectacular piece of architecture in person.
    I would recommend visiting the Bridge’s Welcome Center as it includes many exhibits that share the history and timeline of how the bridge came to be.
    They also have free walking tours as well as Café shops nearby.
    There are also small hikes and bike travels that are safe to enjoy with family.
    Overall, a very fun and wonderful place to visit.</p>
